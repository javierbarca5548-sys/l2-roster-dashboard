# Lineage 2 Crafting Dashboard

React dashboard that helps Lineage 2 players calculate the materials needed to craft gear.

## What’s Inside
- `src/App.jsx` — UI for selecting gear type and quantity.
- `src/data/recipes.js` — crafting recipes for various items.
- `vite.config.js` — Vite configuration for development/build.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the app in dev mode: `npm run dev`
3. Build for production: `npm run build`

## Extending Recipes
The recipes list is not exhaustive. To add more items, edit `src/data/recipes.js` and add a new entry following the existing structure.
